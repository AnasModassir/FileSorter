# 🗂️ C++ File Sorter

This is my first **C++ project** where I boss my computer around to clean my `Downloads` folder for me.  
It sorts files into categories (Photos, Videos, Documents, Music, etc.) based on their extensions.  
Basically… a digital maid but coded by a sleepy college student 🦝.

## ✨ Features
- Sorts files in a folder by extension.
- Creates folders automatically if they don’t exist (e.g., `Photos`, `Videos`).
- Supports a bunch of extensions:  
  - **Photos** → jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp  
  - **Videos** → mp4, mkv, avi, mov, webm  
  - **Documents** → pdf, docx, txt, pptx, xlsx  
  - **Music** → mp3, wav, flac  
  - **Archives** → zip, rar, 7z, jar  
  - **Applications** → exe, msi  
  - Everything else → `Others`
